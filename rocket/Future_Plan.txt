1: Template update function. Given a rocket template, it will rewrite the header to get the latest methods
2: Auto-populate the fieldnames for wtp.
3: Have a error log that tracks the user error

User Readable error-log Construction:
    Principle for user readable error-log:
        clean, no error cascading
        easy trace
        language fitting user's cognitive model

    Idea:
        Make the error log as a part of the template
        Update the error part of the template after each time it gets run, suggesting that the template has to be closed.
        Does this worth it ??????

    Here is a list of potential error message that people can run into (But does it mean always?):

Proposal for having a way to denote to read the source from the sink side data

* In mapping, a curly bracket with the number inside will be seen as using the column with that id from the sink columns
such as {1,2,3}, means using the sink columns 1,2,3 as mapping column

* I'm thinking about to deter the computation for the function that has mapping of this syntax.
