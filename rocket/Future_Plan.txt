1: Template update function. Given a rocket template, it will rewrite the header to get the latest methods
2: Auto-populate the fieldnames for wtp.
3: Have a error log that tracks the user error

User Readable error-log Construction:
    Principle for user readable error-log:
        clean, no error cascading
        easy trace
        language fitting user's cognitive model

        Update the error part of the template after each time it gets run, suggesting that the template has to be closed.
