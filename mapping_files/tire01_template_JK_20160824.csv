This is for the MINOR (not adult or caregiver) TIRE.,,,,,,,,,,,
Generate an NDAR/RDoCdb-compliant TIRE version 1 output .CSV file from,,,,,,,,,,,
an input COINS Report Generator created .TSV file.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Details:,,,,,,,,,,,
This script will read in the specified 'coinsTSV' tab-separated file,,,,,,,,,,,
generated by COINS Query Builder.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"To create this file, log into COINS, select 'Query Builder' from",,,,,,,,,,,
"the main MICIS menu, check 'Subjects are enrolled in a study',",,,,,,,,,,,
"select the 'hgrd1' study, check 'Assessment Data', select the",,,,,,,,,,,
"'hgrd1' study again, check 'Every Assessment Record'.",,,,,,,,,,,
Under 'All Instruments' scroll down and select'TIRE_Tw'.,,,,,,,,,,,
" Leave 'All Visits' selected. Under 'Field:', scroll down",,,,,,,,,,,
and select 'All Fields'. Click 'Add to List'. Click 'Preview >>'.,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the next screen, click 'Export'.",,,,,,,,,,,
"On the next screen, click 'Begin Export'.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Save the resulting .ZIP file, then unzip it. The needed .TSV file",,,,,,,,,,,
will be inside the unzipped folder.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
The script will use this information to generate the NDAR-compliant,,,,,,,,,,,
"comma-separated output file. If no output file is specified,",,,,,,,,,,,
doc_tire_data.csv' will be used.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
This file will be ready for validation and upload using the NDAR,,,,,,,,,,,
"Validation Tool, a Java-based tool you can run or download from:",,,,,,,,,,,
